# Model-Viewer

An OpenGL exercise with ImGui, to view a model, specify the filepath inside "int Application::OnStart()"

might have to learn win32 to access Windows' file system

note: Visual Studio's post build events will fail if there's spacing on one of the names of the filepaths,
don't clone the project to a folder that has spaces.
